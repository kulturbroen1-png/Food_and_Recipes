## 🎯 HOW TO CHECK INGREDIENTS (3 EASY STEPS)

### STEP 1: Open the Dashboard

1. Go to: <http://localhost:3000/>
2. Click: **"📊 Forecast"** button (bottom right)
3. ✅ You see numbers? Good! Continue.

### STEP 2: Find Your Recipe

1. Scroll down to the **table with recipe names**
2. Find your recipe (e.g., "Skipperlabskovs")
3. ✅ Click the recipe row
4. ✅ Monthly costs appear? Good!

### STEP 3: Verify Prices

1. Look at **"2026 Forecast"** column
2. Is the price reasonable?
   - ✅ **Under 50 kr/portion** = Good price
   - ⚠️ **50-80 kr/portion** = Expensive (fish/meat)
   - 🔴 **Over 80 kr/portion** = Very expensive!

## 📋 QUICK INGREDIENT CHECK

### ✅ GREEN = GOOD (Hørkram verified)

These ingredients have **real prices** from Hørkram:

- Butter (Smør): 101.25 kr/kg ✅
- Cream (Piskefløde): 40.60 kr/L ✅
- Chicken (Kylling): 87.92 kr/kg ✅

### ⚠️ YELLOW = ESTIMATED

These need manual price check:

- Beef (Oksekød): ~50 kr/kg ⚠️
- Onion (Løg): ~50 kr/kg ⚠️
- Eggs (Æg): ~50 kr/kg ⚠️

### 🔴 RED = WRONG MATCH (Fix needed!)

- Water → Should be 0.01 kr/L (not 102 kr!)
- Salt → Should be 8.50 kr/kg (not 33 kr!)
- Red lentils → Should be 15-20 kr/kg (not 132 kr!)

## 🧮 RECIPE AMOUNT VERIFICATION

### Check Recipe Portions

**Standard recipe = 450 portions**

#### Quick Math Check

```
Total Recipe Cost ÷ 450 = Cost Per Portion

Example:
12,160 kr ÷ 450 = 27.02 kr/portion ✅ CORRECT
```

### ⚠️ RED FLAGS

- 🔴 Portion over 100 kr = **TOO EXPENSIVE**
- 🔴 Portion under 10 kr = **TOO CHEAP (missing ingredients?)**
- ✅ Portion 20-50 kr = **NORMAL**

---

## 📝 CLEAR RECIPE FORMAT
